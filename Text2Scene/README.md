# [Text2Scene: Generating Compositional Scenes from Textual Descriptions ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01110)
Fuwen Tan, Song Feng, Vicente Ordonez. CVPR 2019


## Overview
In this work, we propose Text2Scene, a model that generates various forms of compositional scene representations from natural language descriptions. Unlike recent works, our method does NOT use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Text2Scene instead learns to sequentially generate objects and their attributes (location, size, appearance, etc) at every time step by attending to different parts of the input text and the current status of the generated scene. We show that under minor modifications, the proposed framework can handle the generation of different forms of scene representations, including cartoon-like scenes, object layouts corresponding to real images, and synthetic images. Our method is not only competitive when compared with state-of-the-art GAN-based methods using automatic metrics and superior based on human judgments but also has the advantage of producing interpretable results.

## Installation
- Setup a venv environment and install some prerequisite packages like this
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git 			# Install pycocotools
cd cocoapi/PythonAPI
python setup.py build_ext install
python -m nltk.downloader all						# Install NLTK data
```

- Install the repo
```bash
cd lib
make
cd ..
```

## Data 
- Download the Abstract Scene and COCO datasets if you have not done so
```Shell
./experiments/scripts/fetch_data.sh
```
This will populate the `Text2Scene/data` folder with `AbstractScenes_v1.1`, `coco/images` and `coco/annotations`.
Please note that, for layout generation, we use coco2017 splits. But for composite image generation, we use coco2014 splits for fair comparisons with prior methods. The split info could be found in `Text2Scene/data/caches`.


## Demo to generate images from captions (will take a long time to download data and run) 
- Download the pretrained models
```Shell
./experiments/scripts/fetch_models.sh
```

- For the abstract scene and layout generation tasks, simply run
```Shell
./experiments/scripts/sample_abstract.sh	# Abstract Scene demo
./experiments/scripts/sample_layout.sh	# Layout demo
```
The scripts will take the example sentences in `Text2Scene/examples` as input. The step-by-step generation results will appear in `Text2Scene/logs`. Runing the scripts for the first time would be slow as it takes time to generate cache files (in `Text2Scene/data/caches`) for the datasets and download the GloVe data.

- To run the composite demo, you need to download auxiliary data, including the image segment database and (optionally) the precomputed nearest neighbor tree. Be careful that the auxiliary data is around 30GB!!
```Shell
./experiments/scripts/fetch_aux.sh
```

- To Generate images with captions from  baseline model

```Shell
./tools/generate_baseline_images.py --cuda --pretrained=composites_final
```

- To Generate images with captions from  retrofitted model

```Shell
./tools/generate_retrofit_images.py --cuda --pretrained=composites_final
```

## Evaluation on generated images (run this to check the evaluation) -Recommended
```Shell
python3 evaluate_images.py
```

## Training
You can run the following scripts to train the models:
```Shell
./experiments/scripts/train_abstract.sh 		# Train the abstract scene model
./experiments/scripts/train_layout.sh 		# Train the coco layout model
./experiments/scripts/train_composites.sh 	# Train the composite image model
```
The composite image model will be trained using multiple GPUs by default. To use a single GPU, please remove the `--parallel` flag and modify the batch size using the `--batch_size` flag accordingly.

## TODO
I'm trying to also include the evaluation scripts and the generated images from the pretrained models to ease the evaluations.
